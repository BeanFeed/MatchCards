    "My vision has broadened since writing that essay, as I now see engineering not just as a path centered on computer science but as a diverse field full of interconnected disciplines and opportunities. I choose engineering because it lets me build on my passion for computing while giving me the flexibility to explore new areas and solve meaningful problems.",
    "Computer science excites me because it allows me to build real systems, solve complex problems, and constantly learn new technologies that align with my passion for programming and my long-term goal of becoming a versatile software developer. To be successful, I will need strong problem-solving skills, discipline, collaboration, and a commitment to continuous learning, using strategies like hands-on practice, seeking mentorship, and taking challenging projects that push my abilities.",
    "To me, being a successful engineer means creating practical, meaningful solutions while continually learning, collaborating well, and taking responsibility for the quality of my work. I hope to begin my career as a software developer and, five to ten years later, grow into a senior or lead engineering role where I design larger systems and mentor others.",
